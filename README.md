The documentation for the pvcStruct library can be found here:  http://pvcstruct.readthedocs.io/en/latest.  Also, 
see the pvcInterfaces library for the API for each structure - that is the easiest way to see the supported 
operations on these data structures.  The pvcInterfaces library is installed automatically when you install this 
package, and so you can find it in the directory vendor/pvc/interfaces/struct directory below your project once this 
library is installed.
